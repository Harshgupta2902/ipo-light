        question: "What is an IPO? or What is IPO Meaning?",
        answer: "The IPO is an initial public offer where companies come up for their share sale to the public by offering their own privately held shares to the public. The companies should draft DRHP with SEBI for Initial Public Offer (IPO) to change their company identity from Private Limited to Limited. The company should file DRHP (draft red herring prospectus) and final RHP (red herring prospectus) for IPO. SEBI approves the Initial Public Offer for the companies, and then they go for the IPO. After RHP filed by the company decides the price band and the date to invest in the IPO via UPI or ASBA format for investors."
